Recreating a bunch of saas products that shouldn't be saas products to run locally and do the same shit.

[Visit fuck-saas.com](https://fuck-saas.com) | [Join waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3JXwoYhwHK0gtnSrTwbSTCP6fY6r8979KYA8TE3XAdABmnA/viewform?usp=sf_link) 

Remember when software was something you owned instead of rented? We're rebuilding popular SaaS products as self-hosted, one-time-payment software. No subscriptions, no bullshit, no vendor lock-in. Just like software used to be - before the enshitification.

Built exclusively in Rust with minimal dependencies, these tools run fast, deploy easily, and scale effortlessly on a single server. Each project costs $99 USD - one time, forever (may do a 'pay what you want' thing instead, dunno yet).

Contributing:
- Rust only
- SQLite only
- html! macro from rstml for all HTML
- Server side rendered
- Regular JS in the HTML for wherever in browser reactivity is required and is something a form can't do
- No other dependencies without serious or obvious justification (a regex package would make sense, for example)
- Projects cannot rely on or require other SaaS products (IE AWS S3 for backups as S3 is subscription based)
- Future profit splits (if revenue is ever created by the project at all) for active contributors at discretion of Alex (repo owner) based on arbitrarily determined percent of work performed/how Alex feels that day/the moon phase. While the code is publicly available, this is a proprietary project with no open source license - all rights reserved.

Projects ideas:
- F-lack (team chat)
- F-onfluence (knowledge base)
- F-ubspot (CRM)
- F-asecamp (project management)
- F-rello (kanban)
- F-oom (video conferencing)
- F-ira (helpdesk)
